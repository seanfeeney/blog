# So it Begins

Late in 2018, I determined it was time to invest in a new portable computing device. My last purchase, a 2016 System76 Lemur, is not as portable as I would like - and tends to have random battery issues. For my new deivce, I wanted something to bring along on vacations, allow me to do basic photo editing (Adobe Lightroom), and potentially some light web development/coding work (a personal goal for 2019). My options as I saw them was somewhere between the Pixel Slate, iPad Pro, Macbook Air/Pro, or XPS 13 Developer Edition.

I'd convinced myself following the Pixel Slate announcement, that it was the device I wanted. Somehow, I resisted purchasing the device at launch, I wanted to wait a few weeks and read a few of the in-depth reviews (Verge and Ars in particular). This turned out to be a good plan, the indepth reviews found the device laying the groundwork for something great, but really stuck between two worlds. All of the sudden, I had no idea what I wanted, or really even needed.

So I took the funds allocated for that purchase and purchased a new NAS device for my home media setup and relegated the new setup to the back of my mind. It didn’t last long, recently BestBuy put up certified refurbished editions of the Pixelbook i5 edition, for roughly $500 off of a new version. I decided at that price point to give it a shot.

A reasonable question to ask, is why spend that kind of money on a one-year-old device? The answer is simple, I more or less live in the Google ecosystem. Between Gmail, Photos, Drive, and my Pixel phone - my whole life is in there (opinions on privacy aside).The device itself is roughly a week old. My initial impressions are positive, and I may have stumbled into the device I didn't know I was looking for.

## The Positives

The device itself is lightweight and feels at home on a table or my lap. The rotating screen is great for consuming Netflix, long reads, or touching up photos. Setup was a breeze, signing into my Google account, everything was ready to go in roughly two minutes.

The keyboard gets its own paragraph. The perfect amount of travel and texture really makes typing on this thing a joy. Part of me wishes I could get a keyboard like this for my work machine (I’ll be looking for it now). The trackpad is good as well significantly better than my System 76 Lemur, but not quite MacBook Pro level either (not far off).

The hybrid laptop, tablet approach of the device works pretty well. I use the touchscreen way more than I thought I would, notably when reading I find it easier to scroll pages and windows with my left thumb.

The Chrome OS ecosystem has been perfectly adequate. A device like the Pixelbook requires you to rethink exactly how you use a personal computing device, but it doesn’t take long to realize for a portable device like this - Chrome is suited for it. The cherry on top is Google’s “Crostini” project. Bringing a Linux virtual machine onto the Pixelbook and enabling you to run Linux applications. Setting up VSCode, Git, and Gatsby (this blog) did not take long at all.

## The Drawbacks

Thus far my biggest complaint is the assistant button. It is not very quick and doesn't function the same way I use my app launching buttons in Windows and Ubuntu. It is possible it will take some getting used to.

The bezels on the screen are large - but with the screen as clear and sharp as it is - this actually turns out not to be that big of a deal for me (at least so far).

There is some confusion around when I should be "installing" PWA versions of websites, and when I should be using the Chrome App, or an Android App. Ironically enough the only Android apps I currently need or use is Lightroom and Snapseed. I am sure I will find more use cases as I travel and use the device frequently, but for now that is it.

## TLDR

To bring this all home, I think the device may have been what I was looking for. It has the portability and battery life I want, the features I was looking for, and ended up being much cheaper than an iPad Pro or Slate (after accessories). Depending on if / when they announce the PB2 - the (thus far only rumored) bezel-less display is the only feature I would upgrade for. Using the device to set up this blog and do some basic photo editing has proved to me that it could be my daily driver. Only time will tell if I can keep the habit up, and if this is the device I keep long term - but certainly for now, it works for me.
